# Hunger Swype

Studies show that people who cook at home consume, on average, fewer calories than those who eat or order out. But, we know that when it comes to cooking the problem that most of us face isn't the cooking itself, but rather what to cook.

Hunger Swype is here to help! Start out by entering your dietary restrictions, then let us know what you're looking for and Hunger Swype will present you with photos of food. Your only job is to decide whether that dish looks appetizing or not and Hunger Swype’s flavour algorithm will match you with suggested recipes.


## Installation

Before running Hunger Swype locally, you will need to clone down the back-end repo [Hunger Swype API](https://github.com/cakeholeDC/hunger-swype-backend)

### Install Dependencies
Before starting the development server, run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed and up to date.
